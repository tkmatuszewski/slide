              We started us kids fascinated by the ocean and we keep it that
              way. The Slide was born to exchange impressions about sessions,
              motivate each other and push even harder on the waves.

              Some surf just for fun. And so we did... until it wasn't enough
              for us. We checked it all from amateur competitions to world cup
              events where we slowly graduated to the pro ranks. Today we find
              the most satisfying watching surfers improvement and deep diving
              into the surf lifestyle.
